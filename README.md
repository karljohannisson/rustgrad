This project is heavily inspired by [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) by Andrej Karpathy.
I'm basically following his [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) 
and trying to implement the same mechanics in Rust as a way to learn the Rust language and also the fundamentals
of machine learning.
